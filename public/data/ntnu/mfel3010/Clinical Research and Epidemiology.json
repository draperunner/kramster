Heart patients with oxygen uptake of > 28 ml/kg min on the other hand, has a 10 year mortality of only 20% (survival of 80%). Interval training has been shown to be the most efficient way of increasing oxygen uptake, and increases the Oxygen uptake most. Studies at the NTNU have shown that high intensity interval training is feasible in all kinds of heart patients. In addition, it reduces risk factors most. Does that mean that interval training is the most efficient way of increasing survival in heart patients?",

    "options": [
      "Yes, interval training increases maximum oxygen uptake most, and thus increases survival most",

      "No, even if risk factors and oxygen uptake improves, is that no proof of improved survival",
      "No, hard training will increase risk of training related deaths, and thus increase mortality (reduce survival)."
