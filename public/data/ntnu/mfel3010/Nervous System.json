      "Utilizing the concentration gradient of sodium and potassium for synthesis of ATP.",
      "The concentration gradient of potassium lead to a diffusion of potassium that is not followed by anionic diffusion, and this builds up a membrane potential",
      "As the concentration differences of potassium and sodium across the cell membrane are removed (equalized), the differences in protein anions will create a membrane potential.",
      "As the intracellular concentrations of sodium and potassium becomes equal, the membrane potential is determined by the concentration of calcium."
